# ALM Launcher
A tiny tool to launch [HP-ALM (Micro Focus)][1] client without legacy Internet Explorer.\
The ALM client layout will look better than the IE embedded one if Windows display scale is not 100%.\
**Note:** You still need to install the HP-ALM client binaries first (or let the system admin copy the binary files from a pre-installed machine to your machine).

## Hints
* HP-ALM itself requires .NET Framework 4
* Normally the individual deployment binary files (including 3rd party's extensions) are located in <kbd>LocalAppData</kbd> folder (`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\HP\ALM-Client\<deployment>`)
